# Bela Magia

A demo to test the [InstancedMesh morph target](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/27669) support in Three.js

Track is [Runa by Ochelie Soroki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARS_OZFZHIo), models from [Rome 3 Dreams of Black](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/3-dreams-of-black)

Inspiration was drawn from an old slavic story I made up on my own
